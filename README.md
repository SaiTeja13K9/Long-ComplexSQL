# Long-ComplexSQL
Solving Long and Complex SQL Queries Using CTEs for Real-World Reports

This project demonstrates how to write clean, modular, and complex SQL queries to answer real-world business questions using structured employee and salary history data. It walks through the process of creating the schema, loading sample data, and executing multi-step queries with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, conditional aggregations, and ranking logic.

## üß† Project Overview

This project showcases:
- Use of **CTEs** for modular logic
- Calculation of metrics like **latest salary**, **promotion count**, **maximum salary hike**, **average time between salary hikes**, and **salary growth ranking**
- Application of **LEAD/LAG**, **ROW_NUMBER()**, **conditional aggregation**, and **ranking functions**
- Best practices for building **readable**, **reusable**, and **efficient** SQL for analytics reporting

## üèóÔ∏è Schema Setup

Two tables are used:

1. **employees**
   - `employee_id`: INT (Primary Key)
   - `name`: VARCHAR
   - `join_date`: DATE
   - `department`: VARCHAR

2. **salary_history**
   - `employee_id`: INT (Foreign Key)
   - `change_date`: DATE
   - `salary`: DECIMAL
   - `promotion`: VARCHAR(3) ‚Äî values: `'Yes'` or `'No'`

> Sample data includes 6 employees across departments, with varying salary changes and promotions over time.

## ‚ùì Business Questions Solved

| Q# | Business Question |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | What is the **latest salary** for each employee? |
| 2  | How many **promotions** has each employee received? |
| 3  | What is the **maximum salary hike percentage** between any two consecutive changes per employee? |
| 4  | Which employees' salary has **never decreased** over time? |
| 5  | What is the **average time (in months)** between salary changes for each employee? |
| 6  | Rank employees by their **total salary growth rate** (from first to last recorded salary), breaking ties by **earliest join date** |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- SQL Server (T-SQL)
- SQL window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`)
- Aggregates (`MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)
- CTEs for progressive transformations

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Run `Long_and_complex_DDL.sql` to create the database schema and populate data.
2. Execute `Long_and_complex_QAs.sql` or `Long_and_complex_QAs - Optimized.sql` to generate insights and reports.
3. Results will show a consolidated report with employee performance metrics.
